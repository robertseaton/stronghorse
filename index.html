  <h2>Stronghorse</h2>
  <p><em>stronghorse</em> is a translation of the performance model used by cyclists on
  e.g. TrainerRoad and intervals.icu to bodybuilding and weightlifting. It takes
  as input the CSV data export from the FitNotes Android app and then generates
  a graph you can use to analyze your training and compare it to your computed
    ideal training zone. Are you training too much, too little, or just right?</p>
  <h3>Usage</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>In the <b>FitNotes</b> app, click the 3 dots in the right-hand corner and select
   <b>Settings</b> from the drop-down menu. Scroll to <b>Spreadsheet Export</b>, click on
   it, then select <b>Save Export</b>.</li>
  <li>Upload your saved <b>FitNotes_Export.csv</b> below to generate your
  analysis. You need at least 42 days of training data to generate a useful
    graph.</li>
  <li>If the graph is too small to read on mobile, try rotating your phone horizontally.</li>
  </ul>

    <h3>Graph Interpretation</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>You want your Recovery line to fall inside the green band, the
    Goldilock's zone. This is where you are accumulating Stress at a high-enough
      level to increase your Fitness without risking overtraining.</li>
    <li>If your Recovery line is above the Goldilocks Zone, you are in a
  deload. This is a good place to be in the week before a competition, for
      example, but otherwise it indicates you are not training hard enough.</li>
    <li>If your Recovery line is below the Goldilocks Zone, you have taken on a lot of
  training volume and Stress lately and are at risk of overtraining and
      injury. You may be training too hard.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>What Each Line Means</h4>
    <p>
    <ul>
  <li><strong>Fitness</strong>: This is an exponentially weighted 42-day average of your training load in tonnage, your so-called chronic training load. The assumption is that the average tonnage you're moving is a measure of your underlying fitness: if you go from someone moving 13,000lbs/day to someone moving 16,000lbs/day, you will be more fit, stronger, and more muscular.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Stress</strong>: This is an exponentially weighted 7-day average of your training load in tonnage, your so-called acute training load. This is a measure of the amount of short-term stress or fatigue you've accumulated from training. To create more fitness, your stress must be greater than your fitness, leading us to...</li>
  
  <li><strong>Recovery</strong>: This is simply your Stress subtracted from your Fitness, producing a measure of your training balance and recovery. When your Stress is much larger than your Fitness, your Recovery will be low. When your Stress is less than your Fitness, like during a deload, your Recovery will be high.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Goldilocks Zone</strong>: This green band represents the ideal training balance to create sustainable increases in Fitness. The idea is that your Recovery line should optimally trend inside this zone. When you're training inside this zone, your Stress is between 0% and 10% higher than your Fitness, just enough Stress to produce adaptations without risking overreaching and overtraining. The thicker green line is at 0.73%, based on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/y3z9m5/which_workout_program_is_best_comparing_reviews/" target="_blank">this analysis</a> finding that lifters in a surplus had a median strength gain of 0.73% per week.</li>
    </ul>
