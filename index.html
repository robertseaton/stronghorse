  <h2>Stronghorse</h2>
  <p><em>stronghorse</em> is a translation of the performance model used by cyclists on
  e.g. TrainerRoad and intervals.icu to bodybuilding and weightlifting. It takes
  as input the CSV data export from the FitNotes Android app and then generates
  a graph you can use to analyze your training and compare it to your computed
    ideal training zone. Are you training too much, too little, or just right?</p>
  <h3>Usage</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>In the <b>FitNotes</b> app, click the 3 dots in the right-hand corner and select
   <b>Settings</b> from the drop-down menu. Scroll to <b>Spreadsheet Export</b>, click on
   it, then select <b>Save Export</b>.</li>
  <li>Upload your saved <b>FitNotes_Export.csv</b> below to generate your
  analysis. You need at least 42 days of training data to generate a useful
    graph.</li>

  <h3>Are you training too much, too little, or just right?</h3>
  <p></p>
    <ul>
    <li>You want your <strong class="recovery-color">Recovery</strong> line to fall inside the green band, the
    <strong class="goldilocks-color">Goldilocks Zone</strong>. This is where you
      are accumulating <strong class="stress-color">Stress</strong> at a high-enough
      level to increase your <strong class="fitness-color">Fitness</strong> without risking overtraining.</li>
    <li>If your <strong class="recovery-color">Recovery</strong> line is above the <strong class="goldilocks-color">Goldilocks Zone</strong>, you are in a
  deload. This is a good place to be in the week before a competition, for
      example, or <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33629972/">during a cut</a> but otherwise it indicates you are not training hard enough.</li>
    <li>If your <strong class="recovery-color">Recovery</strong> line is below
      the <strong class="goldilocks-color">Goldilocks Zone</strong>, you have
      taken on a lot of training volume and <strong class="stress-color">Stress</strong>
      lately and are at risk of overtraining and injury. You may be training too hard.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>What Each Line Means</h4>
    <p>
    <ul>
  <li><strong class="fitness-color">Fitness</strong>: This is an exponentially weighted 42-day average of your training load in tonnage, your so-called chronic training load. The assumption is that the average tonnage you're moving is a measure of your underlying fitness: if you go from someone moving 13,000lbs/day to someone moving 16,000lbs/day, you will be more fit, stronger, and more muscular.</li>
  
  <li><strong class="stress-color">Stress</strong>: This is an exponentially
  weighted 7-day average of your training load in tonnage, your so-called acute
  training load. This is a measure of the amount of short-term stress or fatigue
  you've accumulated from training. To create more <strong class="fitness-color">Fitness</strong>,
  your <strong class="stress-color">Stress</strong> must be greater than your <strong class="fitness-color">Fitness</strong>, leading us to...</li>
  
  <li><strong class="recovery-color">Recovery</strong>: This is simply
  your <strong class="stress-color">Stress</strong> subtracted from
  your <strong class="fitness-color">Fitness</strong>, producing a measure of
  your training balance and recovery. When
  your <strong class="stress-color">Stress</strong> is much larger than
  your <strong class="fitness-color">Fitness</strong>, your <strong class="recovery-color">Recovery</strong> will be
  low. When your <strong class="stress-color">Stress</strong> is less than
  your <strong class="fitness-color">Fitness</strong>, like during a deload,
  your <strong class="recovery-color">Recovery</strong> will be high.</li>
  
  <li><strong class="goldilocks-color">Goldilocks Zone</strong>: This green band
  represents the ideal training balance to create sustainable increases
  in <strong class="fitness-color">Fitness</strong>. The idea is that
  your <strong class="recovery-color">Recovery</strong> line should optimally trend inside this zone. When you're training inside this zone, your <strong class="stress-color">Stress</strong> is between 0% and 10% higher than your <strong class="fitness-color">Fitness</strong>, just enough <strong class="stress-color">Stress</strong> to produce adaptations without risking overreaching and overtraining. The thicker green line is at 0.73%, based on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/y3z9m5/which_workout_program_is_best_comparing_reviews/" target="_blank">this analysis</a> finding that lifters in a surplus had a median strength gain of 0.73% per week.</li>
